      Hey there <strong mc:edit="name"></>! It looks like at least one person has listed you as a crush! <a href="http://seniors.stanford.edu/match14">Fill out your crush list to see if you get a match!</a> You're one of over 1000 unique people in the Class of 2014 that have been put on at least one senior's crush list. Fill out your crush list so that even more seniors get an email like this...and so that there are even more matches than the 70+ that are already in the system ;)
